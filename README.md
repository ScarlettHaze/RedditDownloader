# redditdownloader.github.io

Lets you dump anything and everything from subreddits or users, directly from your browser in a fast and safe way.

All the downloading and zipping is done in your browser, eliminating the need to download a standalone program (for you), and the need for a costly server backend (for me).

## Libraries 

* [JSZip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip)
* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js)
* [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI)

Thanks to [allOrigins](https://github.com/gnuns/allOrigins) for their CORS proxy service.
